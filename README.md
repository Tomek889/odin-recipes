# odin-recipes

## 📌 Introduction
Odin Recipes is a simple recipe website built as part of The Odin Project to practice fundamental web development skills. The project consists of a homepage with links to individual recipe pages, each containing a description, ingredient list, and step-by-step instructions. Recipes sourced from https://www.allrecipes.com/.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I have practiced and demonstrated the following skills:

✅ HTML Structure & Semantics – Using proper HTML elements such as h1, h2, ul, ol, p, and a for clear and accessible content organization.

✅ CSS Styling & Theming – Applying custom styles, including background color, fonts, borders, and hover effects to enhance visual appeal.

✅ Google Fonts Integration – Importing and using an external font (Merriweather) from Google Fonts for better typography.

✅ CSS Selectors & Styling Rules – Targeting elements with CSS to control colors, spacing, and text appearance (h1, h2, p, ul, ol, a).

✅ Navigation & Linking – Structuring internal links between recipe pages and a homepage for smooth site navigation.

✅ Project Folder Organization – Using a structured directory (css/, img/, recipes/) to keep assets and styles organized.

✅ Image Formatting & Optimization – Incorporating .webp images for improved website performance and aesthetics.

✅ Git Version Control – Managing project versions and collaborating effectively using Git.
